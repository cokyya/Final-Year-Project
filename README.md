# Final-Year-Project

In recent years, localization using RF signal in existing communication network or with limited infrastructure is studied extensively. As WiFi and other RF devices have been widely deployed in buildings, it is natural to use them for localization as well. In this project, machine learning and data analytics, will be studied to improve indoor localization accuracy based on radio frequency (RF) signals.

Currently, some relevant researches have been conducted on dataset including Received signal strength indication (RSSI) features or Channel State Information (CSI) using Support Vector Machine, neural network and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) method. In this project, I will focus on UJIIndoorLoc dataset

The dataset UJIIndoorLoc contains large data in different building, floor and region. This project only focuses on building and floor prediction using SVM. The input for each instance is 520 RSSI signals collected from different access point and the output is the building and floor it supposed to locate at. 

The UJIIndoorLoc data is too big to upload, but you can find it from here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ujiindoorloc
